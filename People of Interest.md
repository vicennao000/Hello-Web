Peple to know: Ada Lovelance

Ada is condidere to be the first author of a computer program even thought she lived about a century away from the very fist
invention of a computer
Ada Lovelance father, Lord Byron, was one of Britain's greatest poets but her mother made sure she received tutoring in math 
and music. Like her mother, her father encouraged her to pursue a career in science 
Lovelace envisioned machines that could manipulate symbols instead of just numbers that her influence as a gifted mathematician
way ahead of her time
In 1833 young Ada was introduced to Charles Babbage a mathematics professor at Cambridge, known as the father of the 
computer, and soon she met and married William King, but continued to met Babbage for the next two decades
In 1843, Babbage asked Ada Lovelace to translate a description of his engine written by an Italian mathematician.
After nine months Lovelace did not just do that, but also upended her own set of notes which were three times longer than 
that actual translation. Her notes included some of Babbage's own calculations that some of which were wrong and she corrected.
To demonstrate the machines possible applications she also described how it could be used to calculate Bernoulli numbers. 
She proved it by writting a computer algorithm and speculated that the 
device might be used beyond numbers and could be used to manipulate anything within a fixed set of rules and could be 
used for practical and scientific purposes and I might one day compose elaborate pieces of music of any complexity or 
extent basically all the stuff that we use computers for today 
Lovelace's translation was published and well-received earning her fans in Britain scientific community 
However, in 1852 at the age of 36 Lovelace died of cancer and it wasn't until 101 years later that her work was republished
just as people were starting to actually build the computers.
